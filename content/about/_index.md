Hi!

I am Abhik Jain, currently a sophomore at International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur.

My areas of interests are Distributed Computing, HPC and Parallel Algorithms.

I can talk about Rust all day.

Always open to chats about Computer Science, Mathematics, and in general anything tech related. Feel free to say hi at my [mail](mailto:abhikjain360@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub])!
