Hi!

Welcome to the 186th Carnival of Mathematics, with your host Abhik Jain (if you don't know about Carnival of Mathematics, [check here](https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/)).


Lets start off with some fun facts about the number 186:
- The sum of factors of 186 is greater than 186.
- *Kepler-186f* is an exoplanet, is one of the first planets observed by astronomers which has same radius as earth, and was in the [Goldilocks Zone](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/323/goldilocks-zone/) of it's star (the distance range from star where water can exist in liquid state).
- It is a product of 3 distinct primes (guess what they are?), and thus can have only 8 divisors formed by their combination (2^3 = 8)
