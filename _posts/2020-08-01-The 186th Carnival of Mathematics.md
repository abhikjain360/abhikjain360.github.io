Hi!

Welcome to the 186th Carnival of Mathematics, with your host Abhik Jain (if you don't know about Carnival of Mathematics, [check here](https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/)).

Lets start off with some fun facts about the number 186:

- The sum of factors of 186 is greater than 186.
- Kepler-**186**f is an exoplanet, is one of the first planets observed by astronomers which has same radius as earth, and was in the [Goldilocks Zone](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/323/goldilocks-zone/) of it's star (the distance range from star where water can exist in liquid state).
- It is a product of 3 distinct primes ($$186 = 2 \times 3 \times 31$$), and thus can have only 8 divisors formed by their combination ($$2^3 = 8$$)
- Hexadecimal representation of 186 is $$\text{BA}$$
- the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash of a file containing '186' is $$\text{aaeeefc8f66b433fc4079c06b096c2d63fb9e012d5038eeb8d35cbb9d2110d84}$$

Now, moving onto the interesting maths stuff that happened this month.

Many people are now attending online meeting, either via zoom, Google Meets etc. which are often boring. Add some fun to those meeting with these [card tricks](https://www.vanishingincmagic.com/blog/CATO) that can be performed in online meetings.

What do you do when you come across a bunch of cubes with missing edges? Obviously, but them in a soap solution and see what sort of soap films form around the loops of the incomplete cube (hint: they try to cover the minimum surface area). Kartik Chandra (aka hardmath123) has written the code to simulate this for us so we don't need to. You read more about this on his [blog post](http://hardmath123.github.io/minimal-surface.html)

In the 61<sup>st<\sup> International Mathematical Olympiad, we have now [Artificial Intelligence competing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad-artificial-intelligence-prepares-to-go-for-the-gold-20200921/) against humans. IMO provides a ideal place to test AI in a field humans are still better, in Mathematical Thinking.
