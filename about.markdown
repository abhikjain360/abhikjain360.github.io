Hi!<br>
<p>
I am Abhik Jain, currently an undergraduate in Computer Science at International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur. I am interested in Mathematics and Computer Science, particularly Number Theory and High Performance Computing. Basically, I like making computers and computations in general faster.<br>
In my free time I explore Linux and do coding projects, which can be found on my [github](https://github.com/abhikjain360).<br>
