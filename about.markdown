Hi!<br>

I am Abhik Jain, currently an undergraduate in Computer Science at International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur. I am interested in Mahtematics, particularly Number Theory, and Computer Science.<br>
In my free time I explore about Linux and do recreational mathematics.<br>
